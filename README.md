# Discord Bot Template

This is my template I use to spin up quick Discord bots, complete with the following features ready to go:

- Discord API v13
- Typescript
- Prettier
- Express
- Heroku deployment commands
- Discord Slash commands (API registration and usage)
- Python-Shell interaction
- Python setup for Heroku and Python 3.8.8
- Tensorflow 2.4.0 framework (I use Tensorflow a lot with my bots)
- Index Generator for imports, run `yarn index` to automatically add new commands

### Installation

1. Create a discord bot
2. Add its client id to the `secrets.ts` file
3. Add its secret token to the `.env` file
